At Agoda, I worked on a large-scale web application serving over 10 million requests daily. I contributed significantly to the web application's evolution, leading projects such as integrating GraphQL APIs, adopting TypeScript, and shifting towards a microservices architecture.

One of major achievements was a complete rebuild of the frontend using React, resulting in substantial latency reductionsâ€”server-side by around 250ms and client-side load times by nearly 6 seconds at the 90th percentile.
