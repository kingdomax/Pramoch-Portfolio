I developed a comprehensive web-based photovoltaic calculation system to streamline solar energy project planning. The application integrates [real-time solar irradiance](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/photovoltaic-geographical-information-system-pvgis_en) and [weather data](https://openweathermap.org/api), enabling precise calculations and visualizations through interactive maps and dynamic diagrams.

Automated features include daily data retrieval and detailed report generation. Additionally, the platform supports account management, project tracking, and product configurations.
